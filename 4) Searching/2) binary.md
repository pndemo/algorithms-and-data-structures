# Binary Searching
It is possible to take greater advantage of the ordered list if we are clever with our
comparisons. In the sequential search, when we compare against the first item, there are at
most ùëõ‚àí1 more items to look through if the first item is not what we are looking for. Instead
of searching the list in sequence, a binary search will start by examining the middle item. If
that item is the one we are searching for, we are done. If it is not the correct item, we can
use the ordered nature of the list to eliminate half of the remaining items. If the item we
are searching for is greater than the middle item, we know that the entire lower half of the
list as well as the middle item can be eliminated from further consideration. The item, if it
is in the list, must be in the upper half. We can then repeat the process with the upper half.
Start at the middle item and compare it against what we are looking for. Again, we either
find it or split the list in half, therefore eliminating another large part of our possible
search space.

This algorithm is a great example of a divide and conquer strategy. Divide and conquer means
that we divide the problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces in some way, and
then reassemble the whole problem to get the result. When we perform a binary search of a
list, we first check the middle item. If the item we are searching for is less than the
middle item, we can simply perform a binary search of the left half of the original list.
Likewise, if the item is greater, we can perform a binary search of the right half. Either
way, this is a recursive call to the binary search function passing a smaller list

```
def binary_search(items, item):
    if len(items) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        midpoint = len(items) // 2
        if items[midpoint] == item:
            return True
        else:
            if item < items[midpoint]:
                return binary_search(items[:midpoint], item)
            else:
                return binary_search(items[midpoint + 1:], item)
```

To analyze the binary search algorithm, we need to recall that each comparison eliminates
about half of the remaining items from consideration. What is the maximum number of
comparisons this algorithm will require to check the entire list? If we start with n items,
about n/2 items will be left after the first comparison. After the second comparison, there
will be about n/4. Then n/8, n/16, and so on. When we split the list enough times, we end up
with a list that has just one item. Either that is the item we are looking for or it is not.
The number of comparisons necessary to get to this point is i where n/2^i = 1. Solving for i
gives us i = log n. The maximum number of comparisons is logarithmic with respect to the
number of items in the list. Therefore, the O complexity of the binary search is O(log n).
Even though a binary search is generally better than a sequential search, it is important to
note that for small values of n, the additional cost of sorting is probably not worth it. In
fact, we should always consider whether it is cost effective to take on the extra work of
sorting to gain searching benefits. If we can sort once and then search many times, the cost
of the sort is not so significant. However, for large lists, sorting even once can be so
expensive that simply performing a sequential search from the start may be the best choice.
