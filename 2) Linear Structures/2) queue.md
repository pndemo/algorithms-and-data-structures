# Queue
A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end,
called the rear, and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the
front. As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front,
waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.

The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. The item that
has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes
called FIFO, first-in first-out. It is also known as “first-come first-served.” The queue
operations are given below.

- Queue() creates a new queue that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty queue.
- enqueue(item) adds a new item to the rear of the queue. It needs the item and returns nothing.
- dequeue() removes the front item from the queue. It needs no parameters and returns the item.
The queue is modified.
- isEmpty() tests to see whether the queue is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a
boolean value.
- size() returns the number of items in the queue. It needs no parameters and returns an
integer.

The following is a queue implementation using a Ruby array.

```
class Queue
  def initialize
    @items = Array.new
  end

  def isEmpty
    @items == []
  end
  
  def enqueue(item)
    @items.unshift(item)
  end

  def dequeue
    @items.pop
  end

  def size
    @items.size
  end
end
```
